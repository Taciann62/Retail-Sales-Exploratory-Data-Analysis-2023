# Retail Sales Data 2023 



## Introduction

This data analytics project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte internship program requirements (December Batch 2025).
The team provided the data through an open-source data platform, Kaggle. It contains a sales record of a retail store from 2023, alongside key fields such as Customer Gender, Product Name, Age, Product type, and the amount and Quantity purchased by each customer.

### Project Overview
The retail store collected a well-rounded dataset of its customers to gain insight into their behavior towards the products sold and, in that way, make more informed business decisions. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help the retail business make informed decisions.
Through the analysis of this data, insights will also be provided into customer purchasing behaviour over the year 2023, with each month clearly represented.

## My Role
On this project, I assume the role of the data analyst to uncover these insights and provide recommendations that influence decision-making.

## Data Analytics Objective

 - Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the retail sales dataset.
 - Descriptive Statistics: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
 - Time Series Analysis: Analyse sales trends over time using time series techniques.
 - In Customer and Product Analysis: Analyse customer demographics and purchasing behaviour.
 - Visualisation: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
 - Recommendations: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.


## Business Question

### Sales performance
   - What product generates the most revenue
   - What days are the busiest?
   - What month has the busiest sales?
   - What is the product revenue trend in the year 2023?
   - How did the customers behave towards the products(Gender & Age segment)

## Tools 
- Google Sheet - Data set preview and partial formatting
- R Studio - Data Analysis
- Tableau - Data Visualisation

## Data preparation and Observation
- Data pulling and wrangling: Following the link provided, the dataset was accessible on Kaggle, downloaded from the source as a zip folder. After which, it was unzipped, and a preliminary review of the fields and records on Google Sheet to get a clear understanding of the dataset and its content.
- I proceeded to work on the date, on Google sheet, and formatted the date column to consist of Day-of-week, Day, Month, and Year.
- The data was filtered through the rows to ensure consistency of records. All these were done before proceeding to R studio. You may decide to move straight to R Studio. However, I often prefer to have a direct overview of datasets on a spreadsheet before analysing on other platforms such as BigQuery or R studio.


## Descriptive Analysis
- The following insights were obtained:
- Revenue Generation:
- What was the most sold item in 2023 = Electronics 
- How much was generated by the most sold item: 156,875
- What was the least sold product category? = Beauty
- How much in total was generated by the least sold item = 142,105

### Demand Drivers by frequency of demand:
- Product category with the Highest Frequency: Clothing, with a total of 351 count
- Product category with the least frequency: Beauty, with a total of 306 counts

### Product Sales driven by Quantity:
- What product was sold the most? = Clothing with a total of 894 qty
- What product was sold the least? = Beauty with a total of 768 qty

## Sales Trends in 2023 by Month and Day of Week
- Month with highest revenue generation: May (53,150)
- Month with the least revenue generation: September (23,620)
- Busiest month in 2023: May (105 transactions)
- Least busiest month: September (65 transactions)
- Busiest Days/Peak sales day: Tuesday (161 - count of purchases in 2023)
- Least busiest day: Thursday (123 - count of purchase in 2023)

### Overall Monthly Sales Trend:
- May recorded the highest revenue and transaction volume, indicating a seasonal or promo-driven sales.
- March and September experienced the lowest sales, and demand for sales was relatively low compared to other months.
- Electronics showed high volatility, while Clothing maintained a more consistent trend across months.


### Customer Analysis
The groups provided insights into customer behaviour toward the products and also their spending ability.
- Young Adult(18-24) = 74,650 in revenue 366 qty purchase
- Middle Adult(25-34) = 97,090 in revenue, 522 qty purchased
- Established Consumer(35-44) = 95,335 in revenue, 530 qty purchased
- Late Career(45-54) = 97,235 in revenue, 578 qty purchased
- Pre_retirement(55-64) = 90,160 in revenue 514 qty purchased

Late Career (45–54) customers generated the highest revenue (97,235) and recorded the highest quantity purchased (578 units), indicating strong purchasing power and consistent demand.
Middle Adults (25–34) and Established Consumers (35–44) also contributed significantly to total revenue, suggesting these age groups form the core customer base.
Young Adults (18–24) generated the lowest revenue (74,650) and recorded fewer purchases overall, indicating lower spending capacity.

#### Customer behaviour towards the products.
The Young Adults group happens to be the least revenue-demand driver throughout 2023. Factors that may have influenced these metrics could stem from finances, product style (including beauty, electronics, and clothing). However, their highest demand for each product relates to their age group as they had a high spend on Beauty products, with an average amount spent of 501.1 and an average quantity purchase of 2.46. While the customer age group with the highest drive is the Late Career group, as they generated the most revenue throughout 2023. 

##### Despite lower overall revenue contribution, Young Adults demonstrated a strong preference for Beauty products, with:
- Higher average spend per transaction

This suggests that while Young Adults are not the highest revenue drivers, targeted promotions and product positioning within the Beauty category could unlock growth potential for this segment, and in the same way, a look into current trends for clothes and beauty products could drive sales to the Young Adults. 
However, to limit waste, the retail store should maintain quantity and also check for specifically demanded beauty products requested by this age group and push along other products with them, to ensure availability and also pricing review to provide affordable and quality products for the age group.


#### Gender-based Purchasing Behaviour
Gender-based analysis reveals differences in product preference and spending patterns across categories.
- Female customers contributed a slightly higher share of total revenue, driven largely by Clothing and Electronics purchases, but high Beauty purchases compared to Male customers.
- Male customers showed strong spending in Clothing and Electronics, contributing disproportionately to revenue despite lower transaction counts.
- Transaction frequency was higher among male customers in Electronics, indicating fewer but higher-value purchases.
- These patterns suggest that gender-informed product positioning and promotions could enhance category performance without requiring separate marketing campaigns.


### Recommendations
Below are the recommendations for the retail store: 
- Increase inventory and promotional focus on Electronics during peak months such as May, where demand and revenue peak.
- Introduce targeted Beauty promotions for Young Adult customers, who show high average spend despite lower overall purchase volume.
- Schedule and ensure there are more hands to support sales and product promotions around peak sales days, like Tuesdays, to optimise operational efficiency.
- Develop gender-informed marketing strategies that particularly promote Electronics to male customers and Beauty/Clothing bundles to female customers.
- Implement demand stimulation strategies during low-performing months (March and September) using discounts or bundled offers.
